# mpp-user-archive 2.0.0

This is a work-in-progress rewrite of mpp-user-archive.

[MPP.net](https://multiplayerpiano.net) is a website created for music enthusiasts to play music together (albeit somewhat primitive in certain aspects). The relationship between MPP.net and the original MPP won't be discussed here.

## Is this project safe?

As a member of the MPP community and an open-source contributor, I respect everyone's data safety as I wouldn't want my own data stolen.

The information sent to the server from the clients includes:

- user names
- user IDs
- user colors
- user tags
- a timestamp when corresponding data is archived
