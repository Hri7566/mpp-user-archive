# mpp-user-archive

[MPP/MPPClone](https://mppclone.com) is a website created for music enthusiasts to play music together (albeit somewhat primitive in certain aspects). The relationship between MPP and MPPClone won't be discussed here.

This user archive project is meant to be a backend database powered by the community through a userscript. This userscript is run with a userscript manager in a browser, and, when executed, will send the database server information to save.
