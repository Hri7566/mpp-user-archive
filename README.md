This project is currently named wrong.

MPP (short for Multiplayer Piano) is a website created for music enthusiasts to play music together (albeit somewhat primitive in certain aspects). The relationship between MPP and MPPClone won't be discussed, that is for another document.

This whole project is meant to be a backend database powered by the community through a userscript. This userscript is run with a userscript manager in a browser, and, when executed, will send the database server information to save. If enough people run this script at once, this can technically become the fastest growing database service for MPP as of March 2023.
