# mpp-user-archive

This user archive project is meant to be a backend database powered by the community through a userscript. The userscript is run with a userscript manager in a browser, and, when executed, will send the database server information to save.

[MPP/MPPClone](https://mppclone.com) is a website created for music enthusiasts to play music together (albeit somewhat primitive in certain aspects). The relationship between MPP and MPPClone won't be discussed here.

## Is this project safe?

As a member of the MPP community and an open-source contributor, I respect data safety.

The information sent to the server from the clients includes:

- user names
- user IDs
- user colors
- user tags
- times in which the user's data was saved

An image of the original idea is below.
